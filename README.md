# Calling metacells for a single-cell dataset
 
This repository provides example code that demonstrates how to utilize SURE to compute metacells for a dataset. The process includes data preparation, invoking SURE, and employing SEACells to obtain the expression profiles of the metacells, etc. 

## 1. Prepare input files for SURE
Users can refer to [here](./prepare_mtx.ipynb) for details.

## 2. Invoke SURE to call metacells
Users can refer to [here](./SURE_train.ipynb) for details.
